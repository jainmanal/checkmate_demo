        <h2>PLAY-TO-COLLECT</h2>

        <p>
          The objective of the collectible card is to collect a set of 6 cards. The rarity each set will determine the rewards that are unlocked.
        </p>

        <h2>DIGITAL COLLECTIBLES</h2>

        <p>
          Each Checkmate card is a limited edition blockchain collectible minted to a non-fungible token. Checkmate's commissioned artwork is authentic and scarce - it can only be earned, won or traded but not reproduced.
        </p>

        <h2>UNIQUE AND RARE</h2>

        <p>
          Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique and verifiable proofs of authenticity and ownership within a blockchain network. NFT's are not interchangeable with each other and introduce a scarcity to the digital world.
